# rapido-api-client
In this project we use fetch api with promise to retrieve data from a laravel api project and show them manipulating the DOM.

Before using this project, fork and clone the laravel api project: 
https://github.com/hackademy-es-internals/rapido-api

Launch the api server
`php artisan serve`

Be sure that server port used is 8000 because in this demo project we use it.

Open index.html in your favourite browser and use it.
